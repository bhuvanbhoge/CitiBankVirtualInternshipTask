Task 2: Write a feature proposal
Here is your task
In this task, you’ll write a brief proposal for a credit risk modeling system for use in Citi’s loan management system. Here are your instructions:

Before you begin, review the resources provided below to learn about how existing credit risk modeling systems work.
Determine the data your model will need. What input variables will be used to predict credit risk?
Determine what the model will output. What will the output variables look like?
Explore possible model types and architectures that can be used for this system.
Consider the risks or challenges of creating a credit risk modeling system.
When you've collected all your ideas, write up a brief proposal for this potential feature! We've included a "Proposal Template" in the Resources section below to get you started, but you may write it in any way you think is appropriate.

Once you've completed your feature proposal, you can submit it in the text submission box below using this template:

Credit Risk Modeling Proposal
[Sum up the benefits of a machine learning system for credit risk modeling here]

Data Requirements
[What does a system like this require? What variables would help build a good system?

Data Outputs
[What are important outputs that loan officers will use to make an informed loan approval decision?]

Architecture
[Review the various model types and architectures available for this type of machine learning system. What are the common choices and what will perform best given our restraints?]

Risks and Challenges
[What are some of the risks and challenges we’ll need to keep in mind while developing this credit risk modeling system?]
